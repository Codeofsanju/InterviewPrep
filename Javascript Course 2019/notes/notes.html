            <h2>What is the internet? - 8-23-2019</h2>
            <h3>A start: How?</h3>
                <p>
                    The internet is simply just a long <b>wire</b>. This wire connects a bunch of computers to eachother.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Computers transfer data to eachother through this wire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these computers have a special job. They are online 24/7 ready to serve you all the data and files you are requesting. These computers are called servers. The computers making requests are called clients. 
                </p>

            <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
            <p>
                You could imagine a webserver as a giant library. You can go in as a client and request any website you want, and it will serve you everything you need to view the site. You could imagine that having every website ever in this library would back lookup slow. How is this problem solved?
            </p>

            <p>
                This problem is solved by:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. You make a request from your browser.
            </p>


            <p>
                2. Your Web Provider send your request to an DNS server.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. The DNS (Domain Name System) server maps your website request to an IP address of the website you are trying to access. 
            </p>

            <p>
                4. The DNS Server than sends this ip back to your browser so your browser can now make a direct request to your internet provider for the website you are looking for.
            </p>

            <p>
                5. The internet provider will than send this request to the Internet Backbone.
            </p>

            <p>
                6. The Internet Backbone is litterally large wires that connect the internet. Using the IP route we can get to the server that has everything we need to view the website we are requesting.
            </p>

            <p>
                7. All the files needed to view the website are sent back to our browser to be rendered.

            <h2>Websites</h2>
            <h3>What are sites made up of?</h3>
            <p>
                HTML: Responsible for the structure of a site. If a website was a house, HTML would be the builder.
            </p>

            <p>
                CSS: Responsible for styling a site. This would be the painters and decorators of a home.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript: Javascript allows our website to do things or have behavior. This would be a electrician, or plumbing of a house.
